# Turtle AutoLogin 2.3.0

* Requires a recent enough version of [SuperWow](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/), currently `>=1.4`  

Patch for Turtle WoW client that adds account saving and order features and character ordering and auto-login features.

> This patch saves your login info into `\Imports\logins.txt` so keep in mind that it will **contain your passwords** and thus you should think before sharing this file with someone else.  

> This patch is a replacement for patches like [vanilla-autologin](https://github.com/Haaxor1689/vanilla-autologin) and [Reorder-Patch](https://github.com/Haaxor1689/vanilla-autologin), remove them before using it.  

## Features

- Adds an Accounts selection panel to the login screen
- Select an account to enter its login info (double-click to login directly)
- - Automatically adds new accounts to the list
- Accounts and characters can be manually arranged
- Login-to-last-character buttons
- Streamer mode to reduce information leakage

## Installation

Download the repo place the files end in your WoW folder like this:
```
Data\Interface\GlueXML\GlueXML.toc
Data\Interface\GlueXML\AutoLogin.xml
Data\Interface\GlueXML\AutoLogin.lua
```
